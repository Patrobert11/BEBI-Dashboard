# Business Expansion & Business Intelligence (BEBI) Project

## Project Overview
This project leverages Business Expansion and Business Intelligence (BEBI) data to evaluate the feasibility of opening a new training center in Lagos Island. By consolidating data from different operational periods, we aim to analyze customer activity trends and market demand to make data-driven expansion decisions.

## Implementation
### Data Integration
We created a comprehensive BEBI table by merging the Lagos Weekend and Lagos Midweek datasets. This unified dataset provides a holistic view of customer engagement across different timeframes.

### Analysis & Insights
- Identified trends in customer activities on weekdays and weekends.
- Provided a full overview of Lagos' events and activities to spot high-demand periods.
- Simplified data access by consolidating key metrics into a single table.
- Assessed locations with declining sales growth to detect potential market saturation.

### Outcome
The project generated actionable insights to support decision-making on whether to establish a new training center in Lagos Island. By leveraging data-driven findings, the organization can optimize resource allocation, target the right audience, and enhance market penetration. Additionally, this model enables continuous evaluation of potential new locations based on evolving market demand and competition.
